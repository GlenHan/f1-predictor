# F1 Podium Predictor: A Machine Learning Journey 🏎️

## 📝 Project Inspiration
While preparing for the start of the 2026 Formula 1 season, I was inspired by a project by Mar Antaya on TikTok. This project serves as a bridge between my academic studies in **Business Analytics** and my passion for motorsport. It allows me to apply classroom concepts—such as data cleaning and statistical analysis—to a high-stakes, real-world data environment.

## 🎯 Project Goals
The primary objective is to build a predictive model that determines **Podium Finishes (Top 3)** based on qualifying performance and historical driver/constructor data.

**The Roadmap:**
1. **Phase 1:** Predict Top 3 finishers using current season qualifying data.
2. **Phase 2:** Iterate and refine the model as the 2026 season progresses to increase complexity.
3. **Phase 3:** Expand predictions to the **Top 10 (Point Scorers)** as the dataset grows and model accuracy improves.

## 📊 Data & Tools
- **Data Source:** [FastF1 API](https://github.com/theOehrly/Fast-F1) for telemetry, lap times, and historical results.
- **Tech Stack:** Python (Pandas, Scikit-Learn), VS Code, and GitHub for version control.
- **Focus Areas:** Feature Engineering, Binary Classification, and Model Evaluation.
